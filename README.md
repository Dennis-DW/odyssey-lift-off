# Apollo Graph Developer - Associate Certification

Welcome to the companion app of Odyssey Lift-off! This project is designed to help me learn the basics of building a full-stack application using Apollo GraphQL and React.  
This is my [certification](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/certifications/159603f6-5a89-4b57-aa9e-efe88ece5c7f).

## Project Overview

This project consists of a GraphQL server and a React client application. The server provides a GraphQL API for querying and mutating data, while the client application consumes this API to display and interact with the data.

### Folder Structure

- [`server`](server): Contains the GraphQL server implementation.
- [`client`](client): Contains the React client application.
- `final`: Contains the final version of both the server and client with all features implemented.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [`server`](server) folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the server dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the GraphQL API server.

In another terminal window:

1. Navigate to the [`client`](client) folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the client dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the React application.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser, where you can interact with the application.
